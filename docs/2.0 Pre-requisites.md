Before using this guide, you should be familiar with the following specification and technologies.
  
## NMOS IS-04, IS-05, IS-08
### [IS-04 Registration & Discovery](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04/) & [IS-05 Connection Management](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-05/)
As well as a familiarity with the standards, it is also assumed that you already have a working implementation of IS-04 and IS-05 for your NMOS Node.
### [IS-08 Audio Channel Mapping](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-08/)
If your NMOS Node has audio capability, then as well as being familiar with the standard, it is assumed that you already have a working implementation of IS-08 for your NMOS Node.
### [IS-10 Authorization](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/) 
The IS-10 Authorization specification is based on OAuth2 and is used for controlling access to IS-04, IS-05 and IS-08 APIs.  This guide will detail implementation of IS-10 in NMOS nodes (excluding controller nodes) for IS-04, IS-05 and IS-08 API calls.
  
## OAuth 2.0
Given that IS-10 is based on OAuth 2.0, a familiarity with the way OAuth 2.0 authorization works, and in particular the Client Credentials Grant flow, is required.  The authorization flows used by IS-10 are the Client Credentials Grant and the Authentication Code Flow. The latter is implemented when the NMOS node is a controller, and therefore beyond the scope of this guide.

The following four part series of articles give a good grounding in OAuth 2.0; the first three give an overview of OAuth 2.0 and JWT independent of implementation language. The fourth article is specific to Java implementations.

   Stage)](https://dzone.com/articles/deep-dive-to-oauth20-amp-jwt-part-1-setting-the-st
   "https://dzone.com/articles/deep-dive-to-oauth20-amp-jwt-part-1-setting-the-st")
  - [Deep Dive Into OAuth2.0 and JWT (Part 2
   OAuth2.0)](https://dzone.com/articles/deep-dive-to-oauth20-amp-jwt-part-2-oauth20)
   - [Deep Dive to OAuth2.0 and JWT (Part
   3)](https://dzone.com/articles/deep-dive-to-oauth20-amp-jwt-part-3-jwt)
   - [Deep Dive to OAuth2.0 and JWT (Part 4 JWT Use
   Case)](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-zuul)

## JavaScript Web Tokens (JWT)
JavaScript Web Tokens is the preferred type of token used in IS-10.  A familiarity with JWT can be gained from the articles linked in the OAuth 2.0 section, or from this [introduction to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction).
