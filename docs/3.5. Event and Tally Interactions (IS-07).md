_MF: I believe the pattern for this API is different, as it can include node-to-node communication, and is mainly based around websockets or MQTT, rather than traditional HTTP requests_

![Node to Authorization Interactions](./images/event_tally.png)

[Simon to provide some examples]
Example - initiating web socket connection - decorate with token

Example sourcetally request including Access Token (`Authorization: Bearer`) in the HTTP header 
```
GET /x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/{sourceId}Id/state HTTP/1.1
Host: node.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl...
```
or including Access Token in the URI query parameter
```
GET /x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/{sourceId}?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl... HTTP/1.1
Host: node.example.com
```
The Access Token must containing the read claim matching all Source paths which are to be returned by the WebSocket.

For example, access to the IS-07 Source IDs '9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b' and '7f87027c-ebb4-4640-b878-14952915249a' only would require token claims as follows.
```
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
           "sources/7f87027c-ebb4-4640-b878-14952915249a"]
}
```
Alternatively, access to all IS-07 Source IDs may be requested with a token claim as follows.
```
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/*"]
}
```

```
GET /x-nmos/events/v1.0/sourceId/state HTTP/1.1
Host: node.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl...
```


Within current specification, websocket can be secured with a token, MQTT not security no currently secured by 

Websocket is secured, not the API calls.
