_MF: I believe the pattern for this API is different, as it can include node-to-node communication, and is mainly based around websockets or MQTT, rather than traditional HTTP requests_

As well as supporting IS-10 on putting authorization header on traditional IS-07 HTTP request, WebSocket is  

![Node to Authorization Interactions](./images/event_tally.png)

Example event request including Access Token (`Authorization: Bearer`) in the HTTP header 
```
GET /x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/{sourceId} HTTP/1.1
Host: node.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl...
```
or including Access Token in the URI query parameter
```
GET /x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/{sourceId}?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl... HTTP/1.1
Host: node.example.com
```
The Access Token must containing the read claim matching all Source paths which are to be returned by the WebSocket.

For example, access to the IS-07 Source IDs '9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b' and '7f87027c-ebb4-4640-b878-14952915249a' only would require token claims as follows.
```
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
           "sources/7f87027c-ebb4-4640-b878-14952915249a"]
}
```
Alternatively, access to all IS-07 Source IDs may be requested with a token claim as follows.
```
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/*"]
}
```

Within the current specification only the WebSocket is secured, MQTT is not secured yet.
