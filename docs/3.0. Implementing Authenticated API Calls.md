## Implementing Authenticated API CallsOverview
This section details implementation of API security in NMOS Nodes and Controllers.  .  In this section a distinction is made between NMOS Nodes (Nodes) representing typical broadcast devices (such as cameras and monitors) and NMOS Nodes (Controllers) that act as controllers (such as broadcast controller software).

The  subsections are described below.

### [Node to Authorization Server Interactions](3.1.%20Node%20to%20Authorization%20Server%20Interactions.md)
- Registering your Node as a Client of the Authorization Server
- Obtaining Access Tokens for Authenticated API calls 

### [Node to Registry Interactions (IS-04)](3.2.%20Node%20to%20including registration

### Node to Registry%20 Interactions%20 (IS-04).md)
- Authenticated Registration of Node with the NMOS Registry

### [Controller to Authorization Server Interactions](3.3.%20Controller%20to%20Authorization%20Server%20Interactions.md)
- Registering your Controller as a Client of the Authorization Server
- Obtaining Access Tokens for Authenticated API calls 

### [Controller to Node Inteincluding registractions (IS-04, IS-05, IS-08)](3.4.%20

### Controller%20to%20 to Node%20 Interactions%20 (IS-04,%20 IS-05,%20 IS-08).md)
- Authenticated querying of Registry
- Authenticated connection management

### [Event and Tally Interactions (IS-07)](3.5.%20Event%20and%20Tally%20Interactions%20(IS-07).md)
- Description here

### [JSON Web Token](3.6.%20JSON%20Web%20Token.md).
