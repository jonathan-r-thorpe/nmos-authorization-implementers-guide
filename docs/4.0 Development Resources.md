### Authorization Server
[An auth server is required - link to open source implementations such as Keycloak]
_MF: Guidance on how to set it up for this. See AB wiki guide plus how to segment network. AB: maybe BBC could provide container with config, helped with docker-compose._  
  
### NMOS Testing Tool
[Description and links to the NMOS Testing tool]  
  
### VPN-based testing and virtual workshops
_[Question Only available to AMWA members, so probably best excluded from this guide?]_

_PB: yes, but could reference how we did this (TE blog post++)_
### JavaScript Web Token Tools
This [online tool](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) is a useful webapp for experimenting with building and decoding JWTs.
