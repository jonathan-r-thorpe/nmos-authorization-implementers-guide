##  Access Tokens

The type of [Access Token](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.4._Behaviour_-_Access_Tokens.html) used by IS-10 is the JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is an open industry standard method for representing claims securely between services (RFC 7519). The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed with `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512`.

The Access Token consists of three segments, each being encoded separately using [Base64url Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications "Base64"), and concatenated using periods to produce the JWT:

    base64urlEncoding(header) + '.' + base64urlEncoding(payload) + '.' + base64urlEncoding(signature)

Example of a JWT:

### Header

The Header is used to identify which algorithm was used to generate the signature. The `alg` field in the header MUST be set to RS512.
```
{
  "alg": "RS512",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```
### Payload

Payload contains the token claims, including when the token became active, when they are due to expire, who the token is intended for, and some other standard registered claims. 

#### Standard Claims

The IS-10 specification gi
Details of the usage of registered claims is given in the specification NMOS API Clients and Servers implementing this specification MUST employ the restrictions on claims outlined

| claim | description |
|--|--|
| iss | The  `iss`  (issuer) claim MUST be included in the token. The claim MUST contain a URL value that identifies the Authorization Server that issued the JWT as specified in section 2 of  [RFC 8414](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414 "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata"). The URL host value SHOULD match one entry in the common name field or alternate names fields in all TLS certificates used by the Authorization Server. |
| sub | The  `sub`  (subject) claim MUST be included in the token. This claim MUST contain a unique identifier assigned to the end-user by the user authorization system. For example, this may be a username in a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, or the email address of the user. For the authorization code grant, the subject typically identifies the authorized accessor for which the Access Token is being requested. |
| aud | The  `aud`  (audience) claim MUST be included in the token. This claim MUST contain a JSON array of case-sensitive strings, each containing a StringOrURI value that identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. It is RECOMMENDED that the JSON array contains the fully resolved domain names of the intended recipients, or a domain name containing wild-card characters in orIdentifies principal that issued the JWT. |
| exp | The  `exp`  (expiration) claim MUST be included in the token. This is defined in  [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)")  as being a JSON NumericDate field, which uses the UTC epoch. This is in contrast to the TAI epoch used elsewhere within the NMOS APIs, so implementers should take care to ensure they are using the correct epoch. API implementations MUST reject a token where the  `exp`  claim value is less than the current UTC time. Refer to the  [Token Lifetime](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.4._Behaviour_-_Access_Tokens.html#access-token-lifetime)  Section for guidance on setting this value. |
| nbf | The `nbf` (not before) claim MAY be included in the token.  It identifies the time on which the JWT will start to be accepted for processing. This is defined in  [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)"). |
| iat | The `iat` (issued at) claim MAY be included in the token. It identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This is defined in  [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)"). |
| jti | The `jti` (JWT ID) claim MAY be included in the token.  It is a case sensitive unique identifier of the token even among different issuers. |
| client_id | The `client_id` claim MUST be included in the token, unless the `azp` claim is present in which case it is optional. This claim corresponds with the client identifier of the OAuth 2.0 client that requested the token. The value of this claim MUST exactly match the full client identifier to which the token was granted. |
| azp | The `azp` claim MUST be included in the token when the `client_id` is omitted. The `azp` claim SHOULD NOT be included in the token when the `client_id` is included in order to minimise token size. This claim is included in order to support Authorization Servers which support the OpenID Connect specificen this claim is present, then the JWT  **must**  be rejected. |

#### Private Claims
These are covered in the [next section](3.3.%20Private%20Claims.md).

#### Signature

The signature is created by encoding the Header and Payload using Base64url encoding, then run through the cryptographic algorithm specified in the header with the issuer private key.
