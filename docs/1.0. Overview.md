# NMOS Authorization Implementation Guide: Overview
_(c) AMWA 2021, CC Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0)_

## Scope
This document is intended as a guide for implementers who want to add NMOS Authorization to their NMOS Nodes and Controllers.

## Adding Authentication to API Calls
IS-10 authentication is based on OAuth 2.0 and so to add authentication to your API calls, you simply need to [add an Access Token](./3.2.%20Node%20to%20Registry%20Interactions%20(IS-04).md) to the [HTTP header of your requests](./3.5.%20Event%20and%20Tally%20Interactions%20(IS-07).md).

## Getting an Access Token
An Access Token can be retrieved [from an Authentication Server](./3.1.%20Node%20to%20Authorization%20Server%20Interactions.md).  

## Validating API Calls
If you receive an authenticated API call you will need to check that  [token you've received is valid](./3.6.%20JSON%20Web%20Token.md).

## Getting Started
There is some [prerequisite knowledge and technology](./2.0.%20Prerequisites.md) needed, and some suggested [resources](./4.0.%20Development%20Resources.md) to help get you started.
 
## Terminology
The use of OAuth 2.0 terminology has been adopted in the IS-10 standard. OAuth 2.0 was originally developed for allowing webapps to access protected resource, where the webapp is the Client and the protected resource is the Resource Server.  However, the NMOS Node acts as both a client (when, for instance, registering with the NMOS Registry) AND as a Resource Server (when, for instance, accepting a connection request).  For this reason the Node is sometimes referred to as the Client and sometimes as the Resource Server depending on context.
