# NMOS Authorization Implementation Guide: Overview
_(c) AMWA 2021, CC Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0)_

## Scope
This document is intended as a guide for implementers who want to add NMOS Authorization to their NMOS Nodes and Controllers.

## Adding Authentication to API Calls
IS-10 authentication is based on OAuth 2.0 and so to add authentication to your IS-04, IS-05 and IS-08 API calls, you simply need to [add an Access Token](3.2.%20Node%20to%20Registry%20Interactions%20(IS-04).md) to the [HTTP header of your requests](3.4.%20Controller%20to%20Node%20Interactions%20(IS-04,%20IS-05,%20IS-08).md).  

## Getting an Access Token
Both [NMOS Nodes](3.1.%20Node%20to%20Authorization%20Server%20Interactions.md) and [Controllers](3.3.%20Controller%20to%20Authorization%20Server%20Interactions.md) can retrieve Access Tokens from an Authentication Server.  

## Validating API Calls
If you receive an authenticated API call you will need to check that the [token you've received is valid](3.6.%20JSON%20Web%20Token.md).

## Getting Started
There is some [prerequisite knowledge and technology](2.0.%20Prerequisites.md) needed and some suggested [resources](4.0.%20Development%20Resources.md) to help get you started.
 
## Terminology
 The use of OAuth 2.0 terminology has been adopted in the IS-10 standard. OAuth 2.0 was originally developed for allowing web apps to access protected resource, where the web app is the Client and the protected resource is the Resource Server.  However, the NMOS Node acts as both a client (when, for instance, registering with the NMOS Registry) AND as a Resource Server (when, for instance, accepting a connection request).  For this reason the Node is sometimes referred to as the Client and sometimes as the Resource Server depending on context.

## Specification Precedence
This guide is not a substitute for the NMOS Specifications.  If there are any inconsistencies between this guide and the specifications, please assume that it is the specification that is correct.
