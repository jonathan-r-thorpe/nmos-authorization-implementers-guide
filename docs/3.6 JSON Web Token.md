##  Access Token

IS-10 using JSON Web Token (JWT) to respresent [Access Token](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.4._Behaviour_-_Access_Tokens.html). JWT is an open idustry standard method for respresnting claims securely between services (RFC 7519). The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed with `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512`.

Access token is built of three parts, each are encoded separately using [Base64url Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications "Base64"), and concatenated using periods to produce the JWT:

    base64urlEncoding(header) + '.' + base64urlEncoding(payload) + '.' + base64urlEncoding(signature)

Example of a JWT:

### Header

It is used to identify the algorithm used to generate the signature. The `alg` field in the header MUST be set to RS512.

	{
	  "alg": "RS512",
	  "typ": "JWT"
	}

### Payload

Payload contains the token ms, such as when the token is becoming active, when it is expired, whos the token expected for, and some other standard registered claims. 

#### Standard Claims

| claim | description |
|--|--|
| iss | The  `iss`  (issuer) claim MUST be included in the token. The claim MUST contain a URL value that identifies the Authorization Server that issued the JWT as specified in section 2 of  [RFC 8414](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414 "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata"). The URL host value SHOULD match one entry in the common name field or alternate names fields in all TLS certificates used by the Authorization Server. |
| sub | The  `sub`  (subject) claim MUST be included in the token. This claim MUST contain a unique identifier assigned to the end-user by the user authorization system. For example, this may be a username in a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, or the email address of the user. For the authorization code grant, the subject typically identifies the authorized accessor for which the Access Token is being requested. |
| aud | The  `aud`  (audience) claim MUST be included in the token. This claim MUST contain a JSON array of case-sensitive strings, each containing a StringOrURI value that identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. It is RECOMMENDED that the JSON array contains the fully resolved domain names of the intended recipients, or a domain name containing wild-card characters in order to target a subset of devices on a network. Such wild-carding of domain names is documented in  [RFC 4592](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4592 "The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System"). If the  `aud`  claim is present and does not match the fully resolved domain name of the resource server, the Resource Server MUST reject the token. URI based  `aud`  claims MUST NOT include port numbers, URL paths or URL query parameters. Resource Servers MUST be capable of interpreting both URI based  `aud`  claims which are prefixed by a scheme (such as  `https://`) and string based  `aud`  claims which specify only a domain name. |
| exp | The  `exp`  (expiration) claim MUST be included in the token. This is defined in  [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)")  as being a JSON NumericDate field, which uses the UTC epoch. This is in contrast to the TAI epoch used elsewhere within the NMOS APIs, so implementers should take care to ensure they are using the correct epoch. API implementations MUST reject a token where the  `exp`  claim value is less than the current UTC time. Refer to the  [Token Lifetime](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.4._Behaviour_-_Access_Tokens.html#access-token-lifetime)  Section for guidance on setting this value. |
| nbf | The `nbf` (not before) claim MAY be included in the token.  It identifies the time on which the JWT will start to be accepted for processing. This is defined in  [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)"). |
| iat | The `iat` (issued at) claim MAY be included in the token. It identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This is defined in  [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)"). |
| jti | The `jti` (JWT ID) claim MAY be included in the token.  It is a case sensitive unique identifier of the token even among different issuers. |
| client_id | The `client_id` claim MUST be included in the token, unless the `azp` claim is present in which case it is optional. This claim corresponds with the client identifier of the OAuth 2.0 client that requested the token. The value of this claim MUST exactly match the full client identifier to which the token was granted. |
| azp | The `azp` claim MUST be included in the token when the `client_id` is omitted. The `azp` claim SHOULD NOT be included in the token when the `client_id` is included in order to minimise token size. This claim is included in order to support Authorization Servers which support the OpenID Connect specification. This claim corresponds with the client identifier of the OAuth 2.0 client that requested the token. The value of this claim MUST exactly match the full client identifier to which the token was granted. |
| scope | The  `scope`  claim SHOULD be included in the token, if the authorization request included a scope parameter, as per Section 2.2.2 of the draft RFC  [Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt/ "JSON Web Token Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens"). The value of the “scope” claim is a JSON string containing a space-separated list of scopes associated with the token, in the format described in Section 3.3 of  [RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749 "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework"). The value of each scope corresponds to the namespace identifier for a given NMOS API (e.g. “registration”, “query”, etc.) to which the user is requesting access and determines how the private  `x-nmos-*`  claims, detailed below, are populated. Presence of a  `scope`  matching an NMOS API grants implicit read only access to some API base paths as specified in  [Resource Servers](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.5._Behaviour_-_Resource_Servers.html). |

#### NMOS Private Claims

IS-10 has also introduced some NMOS related private claims, which are related to the NMOS scopes. Those claim begins `x-nmos-` followed by the namespace identifier found in the URL for that given API (e.g. “registration”, “query”, etc.). Each NMOS private claim has the ead and write permission.  Widecard '*' can be used to fine tune the level of access right. In following example we have a full read and write permission token for accessing `registry.example.org` IS-04 `Registration API`.

	  "exp": 1612793516,
	  "iat": 1612793336,
	  "jti": "0f167833-99d0-4284-9980-3e2b2e87f7db",

	  "acr": "1",
	  "scope": "registration",
	  "x-nmos-registration": {
	    "read": [
	      "*"
	    ],
	    "write": [
	      "*"
	    ]
	  },
	  "clientId": "30baf617-1744-4c24-9baf-22351bec1a73"  
	}

### Signature

Signature is created by encoding the Header and Payload using Base64url encoding, then run through the cryptographic algorithm specified in the header with the en issuer private key.

## Validate Token

There are number of steps needed to be considered while validating the access token. 

1. Check that the JWT is well formed , such as JWT contains three segments, header, payload and signature, and are separated by two period ('.') characters. Each segment is base64url encoded.    
2. Verify the signature, by generating a new Base64url-encoded signature using the issuer public key and verify that it matches the original Signature, to ensure token has not been tampered.    
3. Check the standard claims, such as token expiration `exp` and token audience `aud`.
4. Check the private claims, to veify whether it has permission for accessing the API.

If any of these steps fail, then the associated request must be rejected.

At JWT.io, there are a number of third partry libraries which supporting JWT validation. But step 4 checking
