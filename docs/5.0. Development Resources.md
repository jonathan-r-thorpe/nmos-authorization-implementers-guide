## Authorization Server
[An auth server is required - link to open source implementations such as Keycloak]
_MF: Guidance on how to set it up for this. See AB wiki guide plus how to segment network. AB: maybe BBC could provide container with config, helped with docker-compose._  
  
## NMOS Testing Tool

The [NMOS tetsing tool](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos-testing/) creates a simple web service to test the implementations of the NMOS APIs.
  
## VPN-based testing and virtual workshops
_[Question Only available to AMWA members, so probably best excluded from this guide?]_

_PB: yes, but could reference how we did this (TE blog post++)_
## JSON Web Token Tools
This [online tool](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) is a useful webapp for experimenting with building and decoding JWTs.
